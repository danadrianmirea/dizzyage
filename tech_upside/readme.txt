"Upside Down Demo"
by Alexandru Simion
Made with DizzyAGE v2.2


IMPORTANT NOTE:
THE UPSIDE DOWN TECHIQUE IN THS DEMO IS OBSOLETE!
DIZZYAGE V2.3 SUPPORTS NATIVE VIEWPORT SCROLL AND FLIP.


About:
This is a technological demo, demonstrating a few advanced stuff.
It shows how Dizzy can walk upside down, like in Fantasy World.
Also it includes some WaterPlay and a scroll AI script (like in Tresure Island).

Requirements:
PC compatible system with 3D video board (GeForce2 or above).
Windows operating system and DirectX 9 or OpenGL installed.
For audio a sound card is required (DirectSound compatible).
For rumble effect use a gamepad or joystick with force feedback.

Gameplay:
Keys are Z/LEFT, X/RIGHT, K/UP, M/DOWN for movement, SPACE for jump,
ENTER for action and ESCAPE/Q for menu.
If present, a gamepad or a joystick can also be used.
You can mute the sound with F9,
toggle windowed/full screen mode with F10,
and show the game FPS with F11.
F1 will display the About box (windowed only).
Use PrintScreen or ctrl+PrintScreen to save a screenshot.

Story:
No story here, just a tech demo.

Troubleshooting:
By default, the game runs in 640x480 windowed mode (scale x2).
It should have sound enabled, keyboard and joystick support.
The game uses dizzy.ini for keeping it's settings.
You can adjust them from the provided setup, or even manually.
If you have troubles with your joystick or gamepad, try to 
switch it to analog mode, calibrate it, or edit the dead zone
values in dizzy.ini with higher values.
If you experience troubles running the game,
try checking the log messages (enable them from setup),
visit the official web site for details, or contact the author.
