Hello everyone and thank you for your interest in DizyAGE!
Here are a few words about this edititon:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DizzyAGE devtools contain the game engine, the map editor, a few tools and 
the default template with tiles, scrips and everything.

The documentation is no longer part of this download, but it is available
for download, on the official DizzyAGE website. It's made out of three books: 
"The GS9 Programming Book",
"The Editor Book", 
"The DizzyAGE Book".

The official website, also offers a series of articles, tutorials,
technical demos and, of course, a lot of games made with DizzyAGE.
All these can help you in creating your own Dizzy games.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO BEGIN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a beginner, you should start with the "How to begin" tutorial, 
available on the official website.

On short, it saids you must read the three books mentioned above.
They present the GS9 scripting language, the map editor and a practical guide
that covers the basic features and techniques used to create DizzyAGE games.
You can also check the articles and the "Dizzy and the Mushroom Pie" game.

Ask for help anytime and, when you're ready with your game, 
submit it to be listed on the official DizzyAGE web site and 
to be enjoyed by all the Dizzy fans.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUTURE OF DIZZYAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DizzyAGE has reached a new standard with v2.0 
and the v2.3 comes a new feature for scrolling games.

Bug fixes or compatibility updates may be released in the future, if needed.
Future porting to other operating systems or platform may happen, 
but they are far from planning.

However, most of the targeted features are already implemented, 
so not much will be changed about them.

The DizzyAGE v2.3 sources are now available for developers,
so your games have at a very long life ahead.
If you made games with previous DizzyAGE versions, 
it is recomended to update them to the latest version of DizzyAGE.
To do so, check the porting suggestions and the history.txt file.

The annual DizzyAGE Easter Competition will be held each year, 
in hope that more and more Dizzy games will reach their fans
from arround the world. Check the official website for details.

Many thanks to all DizzyAGE supporters,
especially to Peter Teal, Jamie Douglas, Andy Mason
and to The Dizzy Community and Yolkfolk.com!
