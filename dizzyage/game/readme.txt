"DizzyAGE Default Template"
by Alexandru Simion
Made with DizzyAGE v2.4

About:
This is the default game template.
It includes unpacked data: tiles, scripts, sounds, a simple map.
It is a good starting point for your games.
Just make a copy and start adding tiles and editing scripts.
It also includes the engine, used to run the game, and 
the setup application, used to configure game settings.

Requirements:
PC compatible system with 3D video board (GeForce2 or above).
Windows operating system and DirectX 9 or OpenGL installed.
For audio a sound card is required (DirectSound compatible).
For rumble effect use a gamepad or joystick with force feedback.

Gameplay:
Keys are Z/LEFT, X/RIGHT, K/UP, M/DOWN for movement, SPACE for jump,
ENTER for action and ESCAPE/Q for menu.
If present, a gamepad or a joystick can also be used.
You can mute the sound with F9,
toggle windowed/full screen mode with F10,
and show the game FPS with F11.
F1 will display the About box (windowed only).
Use PrintScreen or ctrl+PrintScreen to save a screenshot.

Story:
No story here, just two empty rooms.
No puzzles, no smart things.

Troubleshooting:
By default, the game runs in 640x480 windowed mode (scale x2).
It should have sound enabled, keyboard and joystick support.
The game uses dizzy.ini for keeping it's settings.
You can adjust them from the provided setup, or even manually.
If you have troubles with your joystick or gamepad, try to 
switch it to analog mode, calibrate it, or edit the dead zone
values in dizzy.ini with higher values.
If you experience troubles running the game,
try checking the log messages (enable them from setup),
visit the official web site for details, or contact the author.
